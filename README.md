Input: List<string>, where each string represents one of the known paths.
Each string is no longer than 80 symbols, doesn't have whitespaces,
doesn't repeat in List and consists of directories, split by '\'.

Subdirectories follows main directory in lexicographical order.
Top-level directories donâ€™t have whitespaces in their names and are sorted in lexicographical order.
